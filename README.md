This project implements an Amharic stemmer. It takes Amharic text as input and returns the stemmed version of the text. The stemming process involves three main steps:

<h2>
  Amharic to Latin Transliteration:
</h2>  
Converts Amharic characters to their Latin equivalents.
<h2>
  Affix Removal:
</h2> 
Removes common affixes from the word.
<h2>
Rule-Based Stemming:
</h2>

Applies rules to convert different word variations to their original stem root.
